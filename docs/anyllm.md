## Managing Your Files

Since web-based LLMs can't access your local files directly:

1. **Copy-paste content** from your markdown files when needed
2. **Copy the AI's output** back to your local files
3. **Use file sync** (Dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive) to access from anywhere

---

## Pro Tips

1. **Save agent prompts as favorites** in your LLM for quick access
2. **Use Custom GPTs** (ChatGPT Plus) to create a dedicated PM assistant
3. **Use Claude Projects** to save agents as project knowledge
4. **Chain agents** - use output from one as input to another

---

## Upgrading Your Experience

For a more seamless experience where the AI can directly read/write your files, consider:

- **[Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/)** - Recommended, full folder access
- **Claude Code** - Terminal-based, full file access
- **Cursor** - IDE-based, great for file management
- **Gemini CLI** - Terminal-based, file access
