# Using Beats PM Brain with Gemini CLI

> Step-by-step guide for Gemini CLI users

---

## Quick Setup

### Step 1: Navigate to Your PM Brain

```bash
cd /path/to/your/beats-pm-antigravity-brain
```

### Step 2: Start Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Brain

Tell Gemini about your PM system:

```
I'm using the Beats PM Antigravity Brain system in this folder.
Please read the _AGENTS folder to understand the available agents,
and read SETTINGS.md for my personal configuration.
```

### Step 4: Start Working

Now use natural language or # commands:

```
#boss CEO wants a product demo next Tuesday
#bug Users can't reset their passwords
#morning
```

## Using Agents as System Prompts

You can use individual agent files as system prompts for focused sessions:

```bash
# For a daily brief session
gemini --system-instruction "system/agents/daily-synthesizer.md"

# For bug triage
gemini --system-instruction "system/agents/bug-chaser.md"

# For stakeholder management
gemini --system-instruction "system/agents/stakeholder-manager.md"
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Create an alias** for quick access:

   ```bash
   alias pm='cd ~/beats-pm-antigravity-brain && gemini'
   ```

2. **Combine with file operations** - Gemini CLI can read/write your markdown files directly

3. **Use @ mentions** to reference specific files:
   ```
   @tracking/critical/boss-requests.md show me open items
   ```
