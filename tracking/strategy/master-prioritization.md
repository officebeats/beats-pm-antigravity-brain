## 🎯 Immediate Actions for Ernesto (Route)

Based on the 163 items ingested, these are the **3 most critical points of friction** to solve this week:

1.  **Workforce Classification (W2/1099)**: This is "Now" priority. We need to update the registration flow to handle this properly to unblock legal/compliance.
2.  **Chat Feedback Loop**: Closing the unread message gap is key for marketplace density.
3.  **COI AI MVP**: Implementing the basic expiration date scan to reduce manual vetting time.
