## 🔍 The Master Context (All 163 Items)

_The following items are indexed. Use Linear IDs to query specifics._

- **ROUTE-550 to ROUTE-631**: These cover all 163 rows of Strategic Input.
- **Bulk Import**: Currently identified across ROUTE-615, ROUTE-598, and ROUTE-616.

**Recommendation on Bulk Import**: ROUTE-615 specifically addresses "Large-Scale Opportunity Posting & Management (CSV)". If we want to move this from "Parked" to "Next" for your **Automation Goal**, we should combine it with the **autogenz.ai (ROUTE-618)** work.
