## ✨ Overview

Product Management is 20% strategy and 80% noise. The **Beats PM Antigravity Kit** flips that ratio.

This isn't just a set of templates. It is a **fully autonomous "Virtual Team"** that lives on your computer. It reads your meeting notes, tracks your tasks, drafts your PRDs, and reminds you of what truly matters—all without sending a single byte of private data to the cloud.

**Think of it as having a Chief of Staff, a Strategy Consultant, and a Lead Engineer working for you 24/7.**

## 🎮 The 5 Core Playbooks

We've boiled down 40+ scripts into **5 high-impact workflows** that cover 90% of a PM's job.

### 1. `/track` (The Battlefield)

**"What do I need to do today?"**

- Triages **Tasks** vs. **Boss Asks** (Urgent).
- Prioritizes your list (P0/P1/P2).
- Shows you a clean table view of your day.

### 2. `/create` (The Document Factory)

**"Turn this chaos into a spec."**

- Reads your meeting transcripts and sticky notes.
- Drafts **PRDs**, **One-Pagers**, and **Strategy Memos**.
- Uses FAANG-standard templates (Problem, Solution, Success Metrics).

### 3. `/plan` (The War Room)

**"Where are we going?"**

- Drafts **OKRs** and **Roadmaps**.
- Applies MBB frameworks (SWOT, 7 Powers, MECE).

### 4. `/meet` (The Sync)

**"Prep me for this 1:1."**

- Generates agendas based on past context.
- Synthesizes transcripts into **Action Items** and **Decisions**.

### 5. `/review` (Quality Control)

**"Check my work."**

- Reviews PRDs for clarity.
- Reviews code for "smells" and PII violations.

## ⚡ Antigravity Native Architecture

This Kit is built on the **Antigravity v2 Protocol**:

- **O(1) Speed**: Uses a persistent GPS Index (`content_index.json`) to find documents instantly. No file crawling.
- **Local-First**: Folders 1-5 (Companies, Products, Meetings) are **GitIgnored**. Your company secrets never leave your laptop.
- **Kit Structure**: Modular design (`system/` + `.agent/`) makes it easy to upgrade or customize.
