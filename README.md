## ✨ What Is Beats PM Antigravity Brain?

Created by **Ernesto Rodriguez** — a Chicago-based ex-BCG product leader with over a decade of AI and digital transformation experience — the Beats PM Antigravity Brain is designed to revolutionize how product managers work.

As a Product Manager, you're constantly bombarded with information: Slack messages, meeting transcripts, screenshots of bugs, and "quick asks" from your boss.

The **Antigravity Brain** is a local-first system designed to catch all that noise and turn it into professional artifacts (Product Specs, Bug Trackers, and Daily Briefs) automatically.

**No more manual entry. No more lost notes.**

Built by a product leader for product leaders, this system embodies Ernesto's expertise in AI-powered productivity and digital transformation.

## 💡 Best Practices for Success

### 🌅 Daily Workflow Routine
1. **Start Your Day**: Type `#morning` to get your daily brief with critical boss requests and calendar items.
2. **Capture Everything**: Use `#paste` to quickly import screenshots, files, or text from your clipboard.
3. **Process Regularly**: Run `#process` at least once a day to organize items in your Drop Zone.
4. **End Your Day**: Type `#eod` to wrap up and preview tomorrow's priorities.

### 📸 Information Capture Tips
- **Screenshots**: Copy any image (Ctrl+C) and type `#paste` to capture bugs, UI issues, or design feedback.
- **Files**: Copy any file (PDF, Excel, Word) and type `#paste` to import documents directly.
- **Meeting Notes**: Use `#meeting` for structured notes, `#transcript` for call recordings, or `#standup` for team syncs.
- **Quick Thoughts**: Use `#braindump` to park unstructured ideas for later triage.

### 🎯 Command Usage Best Practices
- **Use Hashtags**: Always start commands with `#` for automatic routing to the right agent.
- **Be Specific**: When logging bugs or features, include as much context as possible.
- **Track Boss Requests**: Use `#boss` for leadership requests to ensure high visibility.
- **Delegate Wisely**: Use `#delegate` to track tasks assigned to others across projects.

### 🔒 Privacy & Security
- **Local-First**: All data stays on your computer—nothing is sent to the cloud.
- **Control Access**: Review privacy permissions during setup to ensure appropriate access.
- **Regular Backups**: Since data is stored as text files, use your preferred backup solution.

## 📸 The Secret Sauce: Screenshot → Action

The Beats Brain is optimized for **Gemini** (Google's AI), which has the best "eyes" in the world.

**The Workaround:** Since Antigravity doesn't have a "File Upload" button yet, we built a pro workaround. Just **Copy** (Ctrl+C) any image or file, then type **`#paste`** in the chat.

The AI will autonomously reach out, grab your clipboard, and start analyzing:
- 🐞 **Capture a Bug**: Paste a screenshot of a crash → The AI logs it to the Bug Tracker.
- 📁 **Instant File Upload**: Press **Ctrl+C** on any **PDF, Excel, or Word doc** in your File Explorer, then type **`#paste`** → The AI pulls the actual file into your brain.
- 💬 **Meeting Notes**: Paste a call transcript → The AI extracts action items for your team.

## 🔧 For Technical Users

### 🏗️ System Architecture
The Beats PM Brain uses a **mesh architecture** with specialized agents that communicate through the **Universal Orchestration Protocol**. Each agent has a specific responsibility and can orchestrate other agents as needed.

### 📁 File Structure
```
beats-pm-antigravity-brain/
├── 0. Incoming/           # Drop zone (screenshots, clips)
├── 1. Company/            # Profiles + Strategy
├── 2. Products/           # PRDs + Spec Work
├── 3. Meetings/           # Transcripts + Reports
├── 4. People/             # Stakeholder Directory
├── 5. Trackers/           # Flattened Ledger (Master Trackers)
├── .agent/skills/         # Gemini CLI Agent Skills
├── .gemini/templates/     # Conductor Templates
├── Beats-PM-System/       # Core System Logic
│   └── reports/           # Local Vibe Reports (GitIgnored)
└── STATUS.md             # System Dashboard
```

### 🔌 Extending the System
You can extend the system by:
1. **Adding New Skills**: Create skill folders in `.agent/skills/`
2. **Creating Templates**: Add templates to `.gemini/templates/`
3. **Writing Agents**: Add agent definitions to `Beats-PM-System/system/agents/`
4. **Modifying Logic**: Adjust behavior via `system/utils/config.py`

### 🧪 System Testing (Regression Suite)
To ensure the Brain is functioning correctly after updates, run the regression test suite located in `Beats-PM-System/tests/`.

```bash
# Run Core Logic Tests (Clipboard, Context Loader)
python Beats-PM-System/tests/test_core_components.py

# Run Structural Integrity Tests (Files, Config, Agents)
python Beats-PM-System/tests/test_structure.py
```
