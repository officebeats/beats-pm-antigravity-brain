## 👋 Welcome to Your New OS

As a Product Manager, you are constantly bombarded with information: Slack messages, meeting transcripts, screenshots of bugs, and "quick asks" from your boss.

The **Antigravity Brain** is a local-first system designed to catch all that noise and turn it into professional artifacts (Product Specs, Bug Trackers, and Daily Briefs) automatically.

**No more manual entry. No more lost notes.**

## ⚡ Start Here (60 Seconds)

### 1. Prerequisites

- Download [Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/) (It's free).
- Create a folder on your computer (e.g., `My PM Brain`).

### 2. Download & Open

- Download the **ZIP** file of this project and extract it into your folder.
- Drag that folder directly into the **Antigravity** app.

### 3. Run the Wizard

Once open, just type this into the chat:

```text
Help me set up my PM brain.
```

**Antigravity will handle the rest**, setting up your team profile and securing your privacy permissions.

## 📸 The Secret Sauce: Screenshot → Action

The Beats Brain is optimized for **Gemini** (Google’s AI), which has the best "eyes" in the world.

**The Workaround:** Since Antigravity doesn't have a "File Upload" button yet, we built a pro workaround. Just **Copy** (Ctrl+C) any image or file, then type **`#paste`** in the chat.

The AI will autonomously reach out, grab your clipboard, and start analyzing:

- 🐞 **Capture a Bug**: Paste a screenshot of a crash → The AI logs it to the Bug Tracker.
- 📁 **Instant File Upload**: Press **Ctrl+C** on any **PDF, Excel, or Word doc** in your File Explorer, then type **`#paste`** → The AI pulls the actual file into your brain.
- 💬 **Meeting Notes**: Paste a call transcript → The AI extracts action items for your team.

## 👥 Your "Expert Team" (Automated Agents)

You aren't just talking to one AI. You have a mesh of specialized "experts" working for you in the background:

- **The Boss Tracker**: Monitors every time your VIPs make a request and puts it on a priority list.
- **The Bug Chaser**: Automatically triages issues into "Red", "Yellow", and "Green" priority levels.
- **The Visual Processor**: The "Eyes" of the system. It reads screenshots of Slack, Figma, or your App to understand context.
- **The Daily Synthesizer**: Your personal assistant who prepares your `#morning` and `#eod` briefs so you always know what's next.

## 📂 Simplified Organization (v1.4.0)

We've tidied up the brain so you only see what matters. Everything is organized into four main areas:

- **`00-DROP-FILES-HERE-00`**: Your digital front door. Throw anything in here to have the AI process it.
- **`🚀 tracking/`**: Your active lists. This is where your Bugs, Project Tasks, and Boss Requests live.
- **`📚 vault/`**: Your long-term memory. Completed meeting notes, product research, and historical data.
- **`🛠️ system/`**: The "engine under the hood." You rarely need to go in here; it's where the AI's logic lives.

## 📝 Everyday Shortcuts

You can talk to the Brain naturally, but these "hashtags" help you move fast:

### ⚡ Daily Briefings

- **`#morning`**: Your "Start of Day" punch list (Criticals + Calendar).
- **`#lunch`**: A quick check-in on what's left for the afternoon.
- **`#eod`**: Your "End of Day" wrap-up and tomorrow's preview.
- **`#day`**: **The Smart Brief**. It looks at the clock and gives you the right list for right now.

### 📥 Capture Anything (Fast)

- **`#paste`**: **The Magic Shortcut**. Pulls whatever you have "Copied" (Files/Images/Text) into the system.
- **`#boss`**: Logs a critical request that you _cannot_ forget.
- **`#bug`**: Quickly logs a bug to the master list.
- **`#notes`**: Appends a thought to your `BRAIN_DUMP.md` for later triage.
- **`#status`**: Refreshes your high-level dashboard (`STATUS.md`).
- **`#process`**: Tells the AI to look at everything in your drop zone and organize it.
