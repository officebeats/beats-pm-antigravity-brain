## 👋 Welcome to Your New OS

As a Product Manager, you are constantly bombarded with information: Slack messages, meeting transcripts, screenshots of bugs, and "quick asks" from your boss.

The **Antigravity Brain** is a local-first system designed to catch all that noise and turn it into professional artifacts (Product Specs, Bug Trackers, and Daily Briefs) automatically.

**No more manual entry. No more lost notes.**

---

## ⚡ Start Here (60 Seconds)

### 1. Prerequisites

- Download [Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/) (It's free).
- Create a folder on your computer (e.g., `My PM Brain`).

### 2. Download & Open

- Download the **ZIP** file of this project and extract it into your folder.
- Drag that folder directly into the **Antigravity** app.

### 3. Run the Wizard

Once open, just type this into the chat:

```text
Help me set up my PM brain.
```

**Antigravity will handle the rest**, setting up your team profile and securing your privacy permissions.

## 📸 The Secret Sauce: Screenshot → Action

The Beats Brain is optimized for **Gemini** (Google’s AI), which has the best "eyes" in the world.

**The Workaround:** Since Antigravity doesn't have a "File Upload" button yet, we built a pro workaround. Just **Copy** (Ctrl+C) any image or file, then type **`#paste`** in the chat.

The AI will autonomously reach out, grab your clipboard, and start analyzing:

- 🐞 **Capture a Bug**: Paste a screenshot of a crash → The AI logs it to the Bug Tracker.
- 📁 **Instant File Upload**: Press **Ctrl+C** on any **PDF, Excel, or Word doc** in your File Explorer, then type **`#paste`** → The AI pulls the actual file into your brain.
- 💬 **Meeting Notes**: Paste a call transcript → The AI extracts action items for your team.

## 👥 Your "Expert Team" (Automated Agents)

You aren't just talking to one AI. You have a mesh of specialized "experts" working for you in the background:

- **The Boss Tracker**: Monitors every time your VIPs make a request and puts it on a priority list.
- **The Bug Chaser**: Automatically triages issues into "Red", "Yellow", and "Green" priority levels.
- **The Visual Processor**: The "Eyes" of the system. It reads screenshots of Slack, Figma, or your App to understand context.
- **The Daily Synthesizer**: Your personal assistant who prepares your `#morning` and `#eod` briefs so you always know what's next.

---

## 📂 Simplified Organization (v2.0.0)

### 📂 Folder Organization

The brain is organized into a human-centric numbered hierarchy, designed for clear navigation:

- **`0. Incoming/`**: The "Landing Zone." Where `#paste`, `#screenshot`, and raw clippings land for triage.
- **`1. Company/`**: Strategic HQ. OKRs, North Star, Branding, and Corporate Strategy.
- **`2. Products/`**: Portfolio view. Separate folders for each product line (e.g., `Mobile-App`).
- **`3. Meetings/`**: External Memory. All transcripts, daily briefs, and recursive recaps.
- **`4. People/`**: Relationship CRM. Dedicated dossiers per stakeholder/teammate.
- **`5. Trackers/`**: The Engine. Master lists for Bugs, Boss Requests, Projects, and Delegated Tasks.
- **`Beats-PM-System/`**: Technical Core. Contains all agents, logic, and scripts (Hidden from daily use). You rarely need to go in here; it's where the AI's logic lives.

## 🕹️ System Commands (Smart Routing)

The Brain uses **Zero-Friction Routing**. You don't need to know which agent is which; just use the hashtags. The system's **Universal Orchestration Protocol** will automatically identify the intent and trigger the correct expert agent to handle your request.
