## 🚀 Key Capabilities: The "Boss Protocol"

This kit includes a **Privacy-First Executive Assistant** layer designed for high-stakes leadership management.

* **`/boss` Workflow**: Prepares you for your 1:1 by synthesizing open action items, identifying stale workstreams, and drafting talking points.
* **Privacy Hardening**: Automatic PII scrubbing ensures sensitive names and company data never leak to git.
* **Stale Workstream Detection**: Proactively flags projects that haven't moved in >3 days *before* your boss asks.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 🐣 For Everyone (Simple)

**Step 1: Get the Tools**

Install your preferred AI assistant (Antigravity is primary; CLI tools are secondary):

| Tool                  | Install Command                          | Auth Command     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Antigravity** | [Download App](https://antigravity.google/) | In-app auth      |
| **Gemini CLI**  | `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`    | `gemini login` |

**Step 2: Get the Brain**

1. Scroll to the top of this page.
2. Click the green **Code** button → **Download ZIP**.
3. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer (e.g., `Documents/Antigravity`).

**Step 3: Launch**

1. Open your AI tool (terminal or VS Code).
2. Navigate to the extracted folder.
3. **Antigravity**: Type `/` to see the interactive menu, or `/setup` directly
4. **CLI tools**: Type `/setup` (or `#setup` for Gemini CLI)

### ⚡ For Engineers (Advanced)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/officebeats/beats-pm-antigravity-brain
cd beats-pm-antigravity-brain
# Type /setup in your AI CLI to initialize
```

## 🔧 Works With Your Favorite AI Tool

This kit uses a **single source of truth** (`.agent/`) that automatically syncs to all major AI tools via symlinks.

```
.agent/                    ← SOURCE OF TRUTH (edit here)
    │
    ├── .gemini/           ← Gemini CLI reads this
    ├── .claude/           ← Claude Code reads this
    └── .kilocode/         ← Kilo Code reads this
```

> 💡 **Single Source of Truth**: Edit files in `.agent/` only. Changes sync to all tools automatically.

### Command Support by Tool

| Tool                  | Interactive Menu                 | Commands                          | Notes                               |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Antigravity** | ✅ Type `/` to see all options | 22 workflows                      | Full menu support - primary runtime |
| **Claude Code** | ❌ Manual typing only            | Type `/vacuum`, `/boss`, etc. | Commands must be typed manually     |
| **Kilo Code**   | ❌ Manual typing only            | Type `/vacuum`, `/boss`, etc. | Commands must be typed manually     |
| **Gemini CLI**  | ❌ Manual typing only            | Type `#vacuum`, `#boss`, etc. | Commands must be typed manually     |

> ⚠️ **Antigravity is the primary runtime** - it offers the interactive workflow menu. CLI tools require manual command entry.

## 💡 Why This Exists

**Product Management is drowning in noise.**

Slack messages piling up. Meeting notes with hidden action items. Emails that say "Can you look into this?" Screenshots of bugs you'll forget about tomorrow.

**This kit solves it—without ever touching the cloud.**

### How It Works

Copy anything to your clipboard. Type `/paste`. Watch the AI:

1. **Detect** what type of content it is (text, image, file)
2. **Extract** every hidden task, bug, and decision—even implicit ones
3. **Route** each item to the correct tracker automatically
4. **Tag** it with the correct company and product context

**No commands to memorize. No manual filing. No lost context.**

### 🔒 100% Local. 100% Private.

| Your Data           | Where It Lives                   | Cloud Access |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------- | :----------- |
| Company strategy    | `1. Company/` on YOUR machine  | ❌ Never     |
| PRDs & specs        | `2. Products/` on YOUR machine | ❌ Never     |
| Meeting transcripts | `3. Meetings/` on YOUR machine | ❌ Never     |
| Stakeholder info    | `4. People/` on YOUR machine   | ❌ Never     |
| Task trackers       | `5. Trackers/` on YOUR machine | ❌ Never     |

**No cloud sync. No telemetry. No API calls with your data.**

The AI processes everything locally. Your company secrets, roadmaps, and stakeholder notes never leave your laptop.

> 🛡️ **Enterprise-Ready**: Folders 1-5 are `.gitignored` by default. Even if you push to GitHub, your private data stays private.
