## ✨ Overview

As a Product Manager, you're constantly bombarded with information: Slack messages, meeting transcripts, screenshots of bugs, and "quick asks" from your boss.

The **Antigravity Brain** is a local-first Agentic OS designed to catch all that noise and turn it into professional artifacts (Product Specs, Bug Trackers, and Daily Briefs) automatically.

**No more manual entry. No more lost notes.**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (60 Seconds)

### 📖 Step 1: Get the App

Download **[Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/)** (it's free).

### 📥 Step 2: Load the Brain

Download this project as a ZIP file and drag the extracted folder directly into the **Antigravity** app.

> **Advanced:** Or clone directly into your workspace:
>
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/officebeats/beats-pm-antigravity-brain.git
> ```

### 🎯 Step 3: Run the Setup

Once the folder is open in Antigravity, just type:

```text
/setup
```

**Antigravity will handle the rest**, automatically setting up your team profile, securing your privacy permissions, and running a system health check.

## ⚡ Antigravity Native Architecture

This edition is re-engineered as a **Skills-First Orchestration** system. It leverages the latest **Antigravity Native** protocol for O(1) efficiency and zero latency.

- **Antigravity GPS Protocol**: O(1) content retrieval system. The agents never "crawl" files; they use a persistent index (`content_index.json`) to find documents instantly.
- **Async Task Mesh**: Heavy operations (Vacuuming, Archiving, Re-indexing) are automatically offloaded to a background thread (`task_queue.py`), ensuring your terminal remains responsive.
- **Lean Kernel Protocol**: Skill definitions are indexed externally, keeping the core context window minimal for maximum intelligence per token.
- **Conductor-First Protocol**: All artifacts (PRDs, Bugs, Strategy Memos) are generated via hierarchical `.gemini/templates/` managed by the Gemini CLI Conductor.
- **Privacy Core**: All "Brain Processed Files" (Folders 1-5) are strictly local-only and GitIgnored by default.

### 🔌 Extending the System

You can extend the system by:

1.  **Adding New Skills**: Create skill folders in `.agent/skills/`
2.  **Creating Templates**: Add templates to `.gemini/templates/`
3.  **Writing Scripts**: Add python scripts to `Beats-PM-System/system/scripts/` and register them in `task_queue.py`.
