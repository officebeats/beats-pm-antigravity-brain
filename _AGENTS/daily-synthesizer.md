## What This Agent Scans (Parallel)

To generate a brief, scan ALL of these simultaneously:

```
PARALLEL SCAN:
├── CRITICAL/boss-requests.md     → Boss items due/overdue
├── CRITICAL/escalations.md       → Active escalations
├── BUGS/bugs-master.md           → Bugs by SLA status
├── PEOPLE/engineering-items.md   → Eng items waiting
├── PEOPLE/ux-tasks.md            → UX items waiting
├── PEOPLE/stakeholders.md        → Updates due
├── PROJECTS/projects-master.md   → Project status
├── _QUEUE/needs-clarification.md → Items needing input
├── _INBOX/*                      → Unprocessed items
└── SETTINGS.md                   → Calendar, working hours
```

---

## Priority Order (Always)

1. 🔥 Boss requests (open, approaching deadline)
2. 🔥 Critical bugs
3. ⚡ Now bugs approaching escalation
4. 🔴 Stale items (48+ hrs no update)
5. 🚧 Blocked items

## Succinct Brief Format

**Rule**: Zero fluff. High density. Use tables for scanning.

```markdown
# [Morning/Midday/Afternoon/Evening] Brief - [Date]

### 🔥 CRITICAL (Act Now)

| Item           | Product   | Action Required   |
| :------------- | :-------- | :---------------- |
| [Boss Request] | [Product] | [Verbatim ask]    |
| [Critical Bug] | [Product] | [Resolution path] |

### 📋 CURRENT STATUS & PRIORITIES

| Priority | Item              | Owner/Status        |
| :------- | :---------------- | :------------------ |
| High     | [Project/Feature] | [Succinct progress] |
| Med      | [Task]            | [Next Step]         |

### 📅 CALENDAR & DEADLINES

| Time/Date | Event/Deadline | Description |
| :-------- | :------------- | :---------- |
| [Time]    | [Meeting]      | [Goal]      |
| [Date]    | [Milestone]    | [Risk?]     |

### 📥 INBOX & WINS

- **Inbox**: [X] new items awaiting routing.

- `_INBOX/obsidian/` (Obsidian sync)
- `_INBOX/trello/` (Trello exports)

---

## Output Location

`MEETINGS/daily-briefs/[YYYY-MM-DD]-[morning|midday|afternoon|evening].md`

---

## STATUS.md Maintenance

**On every brief generation (`#day`, `#status`, `#morning`, `#lunch`, `#eod`):**

1. **Read** `STATUS.md` at the brain root.
2. **Update** the following sections based on current scan results:
   - `🔥 Critical / In-Flight` — Refresh from CRITICAL/ and boss-requests
   - `⚡ Open Tasks (This Week)` — Refresh from projects, bugs, and queued items
   - `📥 Recently Captured (Last 24-48h)` — Add any newly processed items
3. **Update** the `Last Updated:` timestamp at the top.
4. **Write** the updated `STATUS.md` back to disk.

This ensures the dashboard is always current when the user asks for a brief.
