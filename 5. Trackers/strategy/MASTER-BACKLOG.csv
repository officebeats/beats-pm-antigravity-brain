Currently, they manage 15–20 cleaning and 40+ maintenance subcontractors using Excel and Google Maps, handling 1–2 subcontracts monthly across 20 states.All that said, here are some takeaways we need to think through how we take companies like this with their own network of subcontractors, process to manage to these subcontractors and show them our platform is a better tool to BOTH MANAGE and EXPAND their subcontractor network. NOTE: This will open the door for contractors wanting us to add other non-cleaning service type contractors to the platform, e.g. paint, construction, electrical, etc. If we say YES to these additions, we will like get companies to agree to move over, although if we say cleaning only companies in our platform, we will likely get push back as they will not want to manage contractors from two systems.REPLAY LINK BELOW [https://fathom.video/share/oCHf97KySL-NnxqGfWYh98WgjNmtq-qT](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://fathom.video/share/oCHf97KySL-NnxqGfWYh98WgjNmtq-qT)"""

> Attached is a link to a document that outlines the key data fields we need to begin collecting from each company’s Certificate of Insurance (COI). These fields will eventually become searchable within Marketplace. The long-term vision is twofold: Policy Management & Reminders We’ll automate notifications for upcoming COI renewals—alerting both the contractor (at 90, 60, and 30 days out) and the PRIME (at 15 days out and again on the expiration date, if no update has been made). This ensures better compliance and fewer surprises across all subcontractor relationships. Insurance Optimization & Revenue Opportunities By analyzing this data, we’ll be able to flag when a contractor may be over- or under-insured—helping them ""rightsize"" their coverage to match the scale of their business. Additionally, by capturing the insurance carrier name and expiration date, we create a window of opportunity to collaborate with our insurance partners—enabling us to:Offer early outreach and support to help contractors secure the best-fit policies. Generate dual revenue streams through both access to carrier/expiration data and recurring commissions from successfully closed insurance opportunities. Overall, have to believe there’s a strong opportunity to leverage OCR or AI technology to scan uploaded COIs and auto-populate or update the required data fields. This would streamline the process significantly and ensure accuracy at scale.Let me know if you have any questions as you review the document.[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D8GPOMz_3Ro3-YGxrkbG3S6yDeI7Y3ow/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114154587924383815728&rtpof=true&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D8GPOMz_3Ro3-YGxrkbG3S6yDeI7Y3ow/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114154587924383815728&rtpof=true&sd=true)"""

Make this status a filterable field in both Marketplace and HubSpot to support segmentation and marketing outreach. This will help us push opportunities to registered users and better target unregistered accounts for follow-up and conversion campaigns.
> 2. Profile Completion Status Display the percentage of profile completion on each account’s profile card (e.g., “Profile 62% Complete”). This metric should be publicly visible to apply indirect social pressure on account owners to finish completing their profile. For a more engaging visual element, consider using a circular progress ring similar to the Apple Watch activity tracker:25% complete = quarter ring filled 50% complete = half ring filled 75% complete = three-quarter ring filled 100% = full ring Objective Encourage full registration and profile completion by making both status and progress visible and filterable. Prioritize sharing opportunities with registered accounts while nudging unregistered users to take action.

We can assign and where applicable discuss priority level once we start to see the requests in a centralized location.  It should be noted, the heavy lift we will soon be facing is getting contractors to 1) create an account and 2) complete their profile so that we are dialing in strong recommendations quickly.  Currently we can find the contractors in an area quickly although are not sure they are a good match as we are lacking their profile data.  Lastly, this filtering in Marketplace and HubSpot will make it easier to market to those that have and have not registered for an account (two different messages).  Thanks

> Jack Ellison   Aug 4th at 5:14 PM Sure a contractor comes to us and advises they need a contractor in zip code 06103 which is meets the following search filter A, B, C, D, E.  The more we push for 100% profile completion which includes profile data we ask for during the registration as well as the supplemental profile data, e.g. expanded Industries, Account Types, Ratings, Associations, Certifications, etc. we will begin to collect, the quicker we get to providing stronger first time recommendations and opportunities for those contractors completing their profiles.  KEEP IN MIND: On the reverse side, we will also be able to advise contractors why they are potentially missing opportunities (not being found in a search/filter) due to an incomplete profile or not having a particular qualifying filter search a customer is searching for, e.g. not ISSA member, not able to provide solar panel cleaning, does not provide medical cleaning services.
>
> Jack Ellison   Aug 4th at 5:27 PM as you take all this in, I feel think our average subcontract search (filter) for the next six months will be between 12-25 locations per project, which means we are being asked to deliver to a Prime (depending on the density of the market) around 3-5 subcontractor options per location (zip code) - so the ability for us to help ""dial in"" strong initial suggestions based on ""fuller"" profile data is key to keeping the total number of companies they have to vet, answer FAQ, negotiate with, etc. will be key to driving our value and price point.  Right now we are having to recommending 5-8 potential contractors as we have no profile data other than zip, thus they need to vet (in the case of 12-25 locations per project estimate above) anywhere between 60-200 companies.   Let me know if this does not make sense.

> Ernesto   Aug 5th at 2:19 PM I think the profile being a core driver and flywheel of the experience is an obvious mechanic for the product team. 2:20 The mindset we should have is that people will not trust us and will need to be subtly and organically show reasons to complete a profile. 2:20 Assume the users do not trust us. 2:20 Assume the users don't have time to fill out the information 2:21 Assume the users don't even want our help because they're already busy enough with their business. (edited)  2:21 We should build an experience that is mindful of this, and gradually gains the trust of the users to incrementally provide the right information at the right time."

29,ROUTE-582,Maybe Subcontracting Option,"Add ""Maybe"" Option for Subcontract Status",Next,Engagement,Profile,Nurtures hesitant subs with opportunity alerts,Low,"## 💡 Feature Request Idea Summary

* The feature requests adding a third option, **""Maybe (Open To Review Opportunities)""**, to the existing ""Open To Subcontract Opportunities"" field for contractors. 
* The goal is to avoid closing the door completely on contractors who are hesitant to engage in subcontracting due to past negative experiences. 
* This ""Maybe"" status allows them to receive opportunity alerts, providing market insight and business intelligence, and encourages them to consider opportunities on a case-by-case basis. The intent is to nurture contractors and keep them engaged with the platform.

### 2\. User Story

* As a **Sales/Onboarding Team Member**, 
* I want to **set a contractor's subcontracting preference to ""Maybe (Open To Review Opportunities)""** 
* so that **I can nurture hesitant contractors by keeping them engaged with relevant opportunity alerts and eventually convert them to ""Yes.""**

### 3\. Acceptance Criteria (AC)

* The ""Open To Subcontract Opportunities"" field on the contractor profile/settings must include the following three selectable options for the user:
  * **Yes**
  * **No**
  * **Maybe (Open To Review Opportunities)**
* The selected option must be successfully saved to the backend system upon form submission.
* The backend alert system must include all companies where the ""Open To Subcontract Opportunities"" field is set to **""Yes""** OR **""Maybe (Open To Review Opportunities)""** in the distribution list for subcontract opportunity alerts.
* Companies selecting **""No""** must be excluded from receiving these opportunity alerts.

---

## Open Questions for the Product Team

* **Data Field Name/Value:** What is the precise backend field name and the associated value for the ""Maybe (Open To Review Opportunities)"" option? (e.g., `is_open_to_subcontract: 'maybe'`).
* **System of Record:** Is this preference field being implemented in the new ""Exchange"" platform, or is this an update to an existing system like HubSpot?
* **""Maybe"" Field Value Persistence:** Does the ""Maybe"" preference persist indefinitely, or is there an intention to set an expiration date or require re-confirmation after a certain period (e.g., 6 months) to ensure the preference is still accurate?
* **Alert Customization:** For the MVP, should the content, format, or frequency of the alerts be identical for both ""Yes"" and ""Maybe"" users?

* The system needs to **dynamically adjust required form fields** on a user's profile based on the state they select, addressing state-specific compliance mandates.
* This adjustment should happen during the **profile creation/info input flow** for service partners.
* This feature aims to move the existing process out of the current ""Chat section"" and into a structured data collection flow, starting post-ISSA.

# User Story

* As a **Service Partner User**,
* I want the **profile input flow** to dynamically mark fields like 'Business License' or 'Training Certification' as **MANDATORY** based on the selected state,
* so that I am **guided to complete all state-mandated compliance requirements** and maintain a certified profile.

## **Acceptance Criteria (AC)**

* The user must be prompted to select the primary state of operation during the profile input/claiming flow.
* Upon selecting a state (e.g., California), specific related fields (e.g., Sexual Assault Training Certificate, Business License Number) must **immediately change from optional to mandated**.
* Mandatory fields must be visually indicated as required (e.g., with an asterisk $\*$).
* The user must be **prevented from submitting** their profile or advancing the flow until all state-mandated fields are complete and valid.
* If the user selects a state with no known mandates (e.g., State X), the fields must remain **optional**.

## User Story

* As a **PRIME or SUBCONTRACTOR user**,
* I want to **initiate, submit, and view structured, aggregated, and filterable ratings and reviews** for partnership opportunities with appropriate transparency and access controls,
* so that **performance is officially tracked, analyzed over time, and openly discussed** between the involved parties without public exposure of the partnership details.

## **Acceptance Criteria (AC)**

* The system must allow a user to initiate a rating/review for an active opportunity after a defined period (e.g., related to a QBR cycle).
* The rating form must require a **1-5 star rating** with **half-star increments** (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, etc.) and a **mandatory feedback field** for each question.
* The system must automatically calculate and display an **overall star rating** upon completion of the review.
* A dedicated dashboard must display submitted ratings and reviews individually and as an **aggregated summary**.
* The summary must include filtering options by **date range** (e.g., Past 6 Months, Past Year), **score** (e.g., highest to lowest), and **chronology** (e.g., newest to oldest).
* Users must be able to **submit a counter-response** to any submitted review.
* All submitted feedback and counter-responses must be visible and transparent to platform users.
* **Access Control:** The identity of the **PRIME and SUBCONTRACTOR** involved in a specific review must **only be visible to those two involved parties**; all other users must see an anonymized view.

> ""@Mitesh Shah @Om @Willow Kowalski Attached is a link to a document that outlines the key data fields we need to begin collecting from each company’s Certificate of Insurance (COI). These fields will eventually become searchable within Marketplace. The long-term vision is twofold: Policy Management & Reminders We’ll automate notifications for upcoming COI renewals—alerting both the contractor (at 90, 60, and 30 days out) and the PRIME (at 15 days out and again on the expiration date, if no update has been made). This ensures better compliance and fewer surprises across all subcontractor relationships. Insurance Optimization & Revenue Opportunities By analyzing this data, we’ll be able to flag when a contractor may be over- or under-insured—helping them ""rightsize"" their coverage to match the scale of their business. Additionally, by capturing the insurance carrier name and expiration date, we create a window of opportunity to collaborate with our insurance partners—enabling us to:Offer early outreach and support to help contractors secure the best-fit policies. Generate dual revenue streams through both access to carrier/expiration data and recurring commissions from successfully closed insurance opportunities. Overall, have to believe there’s a strong opportunity to leverage OCR or AI technology to scan uploaded COIs and auto-populate or update the required data fields. This would streamline the process significantly and ensure accuracy at scale.Let me know if you have any questions as you review the document.

I am assuming these contacts within HubSpot will eventually make it over to Route Marketplace or vice versa. To that end, each of these contacts will have 1) unique profiles on if/when/where their contact info is shared within Route Marketplace and 2) the email notices they should/need to receive.For example, a primary sale contact for a company needs to have their information shared in the company profile although there are 2 other sales contacts within the company. that may or may not need to be listed On the reverse side each of these three sales contacts want to be alerted to sales opportunity, although the president, director of marketing, accounts payables lead will not need to get these notices although they would like to be made aware of live events we are hosting, platform updates, etc. In short lots of communications variables.

* The core feature is to **enhance contact information capture** on Contractor profiles by adding specific, distinguishable fields for different contact needs: an **Emergency/After Hours number** and separate **Cell/Office numbers**.
* This addresses a priority request to improve critical communication channels for clients and partners.

## User Story

* As a **Contractor User**,
* I want to have **separate, designated fields for Phone, Cell, and a mandatory After Hours/Emergency number** on my profile,
* so that all necessary parties can **contact me efficiently based on urgency and time of day**, improving communication and response times for critical events.

## **Acceptance Criteria (AC)**

* The Contractor profile input form must be updated to include three distinct, separate fields for contact numbers:
  1. **After Hours/Emergency Number**
  2. **Cell (Mobile) Number**
  3. **Phone (Office/Landline) Number**
* The **After Hours/Emergency Number** field must be clearly labeled and treated as **mandatory** for Contractor completion.
* All three fields must accept and store valid phone number formats.
* The system must save and display these distinct numbers accurately on the Contractor's profile for relevant viewing parties.
* **Migration Consideration:** Existing contact data must be reviewed and handled appropriately to populate the most relevant new field (e.g., if only one number exists, it should default to the ""Phone"" field, leaving ""Cell"" and ""Emergency"" blank or requiring user update).

* The Cell Phone number is validated to ensure it is in an **acceptable phone number format**.

* The existing **""W-2 vs 1099 Data Capture/Calculation""** needs to be updated to capture a more accurate and flexible view of a company's subcontracting utilization.
* The current **""Company Size (W-2 Employees)""** field should be made clearer by updating its header.
* The vague **""1099 Subcontracted %""** field should be replaced with **two specific, quantitative metrics** that allow Prime Contractors to better filter, assess, and engage with potential subcontractors.

## User Story

As a **Subcontractor**, 

I want to **input specific, standardized metrics** regarding my company's **W-2 employee size and 1099 subcontracting utilization**, 

so that **Prime Contractors can accurately filter and assess my company's capabilities** based on their self-performing vs. subcontracting requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

* The header/label for the existing field tracking W-2 employee count is updated to **""Company Size (W-2 Employees)""**.
* The following new data fields are added to the company profile data capture section (replacing the current ""1099 Subcontracted %"" field):
  * **Number of Subcontractor (1099) Companies** (Input field for an integer/whole number).
  * **Percentage Of Work Subcontracted** (Input field for a percentage, allowing one decimal place, e.g., XX.X).
* Both new fields are **mandatory** to ensure Prime Contractors have the baseline information required for filtering.
* The system must store the data for the new fields and display them on the contractor's profile viewable by Prime Contractors.

> Based on feedback from Frank W. at The Facilities Group (they work with over 3,000 ISP - Independent Service Providers) as it pertains to the W-2 vs 1099 Data Capture/Calculation Discussion, they calculate from two angles - Revenue % and % Of Contract.  Revenue % is an easy to understand calculation, although while % Of Contract is easy to calculate at the Opportunity Level (can go % labor hours, % revenue, % people), when you start to roll all Opportunities and Contracts into a Company Level snapshot, the number becomes a little more gray and ""what it you want it to be for the client calculation"".
> Based on this feedback and other feedback collected, proposing we update the W-2 vs 1099 Data Capture/Calculation as follows:
>
> * a) For the **Company Size (W-2 Employees)** data point < suggest we update header as shown to left so clear and we still utilize and capture the current drop down range
> * b) For the **1099 Subcontracted %** < Since the feedback we are receiving is every company calculates this percentage differently, e.g. employee (individual) vs subcontractor (individual), revenue W-2 vs 1099, account count W-2 vs 1099, I suggest we capture this data with two data fields/numbers that will give the Prime's enough baseline info and insights to understand the level of subcontracting occurring with a given contractor.  Based on these two fields/numbers, the PRIME will be able to 1) filter in/out what they are looking for and 2) when a match is made determine if additional conversation is needed around a given opportunity, e.g. we want you to self performing this opportunity at minimum this percentage.  The two data fields/numbers are:
