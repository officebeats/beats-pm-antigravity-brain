# 🧠 Brain Dump (Chaos Mode)

> **Just type.** Don't worry about format, capitalization, or order.
> Paste screenshots, write angry notes, drop feature ideas, or list tasks.
>
> **When you're ready to organize:**  
> Run the command `#day` (or ask "Process my brain dump") and I will sort this into your `ACTION_PLAN.md`, Backlog, or Bug Tracker.
