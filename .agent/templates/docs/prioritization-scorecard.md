## Scoring Criteria

### RICE

| Dimension | Scale | Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reach** | # users/quarter | How many users impacted this quarter |
| **Impact** | 0.25 / 0.5 / 1 / 2 / 3 | Minimal / Low / Medium / High / Massive |
| **Confidence** | 50% / 80% / 100% | How sure? Data > Anecdote > Gut |
| **Effort** | Person-months | Estimated implementation effort |

**Formula**: `RICE = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort`
