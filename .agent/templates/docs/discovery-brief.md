## Problem Space

- **Who**: [Target user/persona]
- **What**: [The problem or unmet need — frame as user pain, not solution]
- **Evidence**: [What signals brought us here — data, quotes, complaints, support tickets]
- **Impact**: [What happens to users/business if we don't solve this]

## Desired Outcome

| Dimension | Target |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Business Metric** | [What moves for us — e.g., reduce churn by 10%] |
| **User Outcome** | [What improves for them — e.g., complete pre-reg in <3 min] |

## Pivot/Persevere Criteria

**Persevere If** (all must be true):
- [ ] Top desirability assumption validated (≥3 user confirmations)
- [ ] Feasibility confirmed by engineering (spike complete)
- [ ] Business case viable (projected impact > cost)

**Pivot If**:
- [ ] Core assumption invalidated → explore adjacent opportunity

**Stop If**:
- [ ] No viable path after [X] experiments → document learnings, kill initiative
