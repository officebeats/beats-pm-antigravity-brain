# 🎨 UX Engineering Playbook

This workflow guides the **Frontend Specialist** to build, extend, and polish user interfaces.

## Steps

1. **Understand Layout & Specs**:
   - Review incoming design tasks, mockups, or user requests.
   - Identify the component hierarchy, state management needs, and CSS approach.

2. **Develop Components**:
   - Write React/TypeScript code using semantic HTML.
   - Apply modern CSS or utility classes for responsive, beautiful design.
   - Ensure a11y (accessibility) features are built-in from the ground up (ARIA, focus states, keyboard navigation).

3. **Verify Performance & Quality**:
   - Check React best practices (no unnecessary re-renders, correct hook dependencies).
   - Validate responsive behaviors across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.

4. **Output**:
   - Deliver clean, modular, and maintainable frontend files that drastically improve the user experience.
