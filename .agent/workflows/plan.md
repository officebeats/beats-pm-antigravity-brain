# 🗺️ Strategy & Planning Playbook

This workflow guides the **Product Strategist** to define the "What" and "Why".

## Steps

1.  **Context Loading**:
    - **Identify**: Is this an Annual, Quarterly, or Feature Plan?
    - **Search**: Look for existing Strategy docs in `1. Company/` or `2. Products/`.
    - **Hydrate**: Read `5. Trackers/okr_tracking.md` if relevant.

2.  **Framework Selection**:
    - Ask the user which framework to apply:
      - **7 Powers** (Moats)
      - **Driscoll** (What? So What? Now What?)
      - **Amazon Working Backwards** (Press Release)

3.  **Drafting**:
    - Use `chief-strategy-officer` skill to draft the content.
    - Ensure meaningful links to `1. Company/PROFILE.md`.

4.  **Output**:
    - Save to `2. Products/[Product]/STRATEGY.md` or `1. Company/STRATEGY_FY26.md`.
