# Interview Simulator Skill

Use this skill when the user wants to practice for an interview (`/prep` or "mock interview").

## Process

### 1. Setup
Ask the user:
*   **Target Role**: (e.g., Sr. Director of Product)
*   **Target Company**: (e.g., Datavant)
*   **Focus Area**: (Behavioral, Strategy, Technical, or Mixed)

### 2. The Loop (Repeat 3-5 times)
1.  **Question**: Ask a challenging, role-appropriate question.
2.  **Listen**: Wait for user response.
3.  **Critique**:
    *   **STAR Check**: Did they use Situation, Task, Action, Result?
    *   **Impact Check**: Did they mention metrics?
    *   **Conciseness**: Was it under 2 minutes?
4.  **Refine**: Suggest a "Gold Standard" version of their answer.

### 3. Debrief
*   Summarize strengths and weaknesses.
*   Assign "Homework" (e.g., "Refine your 'Tell me about yourself' story").
