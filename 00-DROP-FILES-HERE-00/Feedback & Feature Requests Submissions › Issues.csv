"ROUTE-609","Get Route","Minimum Wage Tracker Reference Link","## 2\. Feature Request Idea Summary

* **Feature:** Include a direct reference link to the EPI Minimum Wage Tracker within the contract posting and review interface.
* **Goal:** Ensure all users (Primes and Subs) are educated on the local minimum wage requirements relevant to the contract location.
* **Problem Solved:** Provides a standard, external resource for local labor rates, aiding compliance and setting clear expectations during contract negotiation.

---

## 3\. User Story

* As a **Contractor posting or reviewing a contract**,
* I want to **have quick access to a third-party minimum wage tracker link**,
* so that **I can easily verify the current local minimum and tipped wages for the contract's location.**

---

## 4\. Acceptance Criteria (AC)

* The link to the **EPI Minimum Wage Tracker** (`https://www.epi.org/minimum-wage-tracker/#/min_wage/New%20Jersey`) must be added to the interface for **posting a contract**.
* The link must also be present in the interface for **reviewing a contract**.
* The link should be clearly labeled (e.g., ""Check Local Minimum Wage"").
* The link should open in a **new tab/window** so the user does not lose their place in the Route Marketplace workflow.
* The link should ideally use the contract location (City/State) to dynamically pre-filter the tracker if technically feasible (e.g., linking to the specific state).

---

## 5\. Open Questions for the Product Team

* Where is the **most logical placement** for this link in the Contract Posting and Contract Review workflows (e.g., near the contract location or financial details)?
* What is the **technical effort** required to dynamically update the link to pre-filter based on the contract's **State** (e.g., changing the URL fragment)?
* Does the legal team need to review the **EPI tracker** before it is formally included as a resource?

* **Feature:** Implement an AI-driven text scanning capability to validate key compliance details on uploaded Certificates of Insurance (COI) for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
* **Goal:** Use AI to verify the current status of legal documents by checking for expiration and confirming they match the associated business profile.
* **Problem Solved:** Ensures basic compliance and document validity early in the process without requiring complex third-party system integrations, streamlining the document review workflow.

---

## 3\. User Story

* As a **Contractor** uploading my COI,
* I want the **system to automatically scan the document using AI to check for key compliance points**,
* so that **I get quick validation that my documents are not expired and correctly associated with my profile.**

---

## 4\. Acceptance Criteria (AC)

* The system must implement a **simple AI-driven text scan** functionality upon COI upload.
* The AI scan must specifically look for and validate the **expiration date** of the document.
* The AI scan must validate that the document's essential details **match the corresponding business profile** (e.g., company name).
* The system must display a clear **pass/fail status** to the user based on the expiration and profile match validation.
* **Non-Functional Constraint:** The MVP must **avoid integrating** with external third-party compliance/vendor management platforms (e.g., VendorPM) for this functionality in the near term (targeting next year for integration).

---

## 5\. Open Questions for the Product Team

* What are the **specific data points** (besides expiration date and company name) that the AI scan must validate against the business profile for MVP?
* What is the defined **level of confidence/accuracy** required for the AI text scan to consider a document ""validated""?
* How should the system handle a **validation failure** (e.g., block profile completion, or allow completion but flag the profile as non-compliant)?

* **Feature:** Develop features that allow Prime contractors to manage their existing network of subcontractors (beyond cleaning services) within the platform.
* **Goal:** Position the platform as a superior solution to current manual methods (Excel/Google Maps) for both **managing** and **expanding** a Prime contractor's entire subcontractor base.
* **Problem Solved:** Addresses the critical need of companies like New Image to consolidate management of their **40+ maintenance subs** and **non-cleaning subs** into one system, preventing pushback on platform adoption.

---

## 3\. User Story

* As a **Prime Contractor** (e.g., New Image Building Services),
* I want to **manage my entire network of subcontractors, including both cleaning and non-cleaning service types (e.g., maintenance, electrical),**
* so that **I can consolidate my workflow away from manual tools (Excel/Google Maps) and use Route as my single system for subcontracting.**

---

## 4\. Acceptance Criteria (AC)

* The platform must support the **import/manual addition** of a Prime's existing subcontractor network (e.g., New Image's 15-20 cleaning and 40+ maintenance subs).
* The platform must enable the **management** (tracking, communication, assignments) of these imported subcontractors, whether they are officially registered on the Marketplace or not.
* **Service Type Expansion Decision:** A definitive decision must be made regarding the inclusion of **non-cleaning service types** (e.g., paint, construction, electrical) on the platform.
  * If **YES**, the system must update Service Type filters to include these new categories.
  * If **NO**, a strategy must be developed to address user resistance to managing multiple systems.
* The system must demonstrate a clear advantage over basic tools like Excel and Google Maps for **tracking subcontractor activity and performance**.
* The platform must integrate tools that facilitate the current Prime workflow (handling 1-2 subcontracts monthly across multiple states).

---

## 5\. Open Questions for the Product Team

* **SCOPE DECISION:** Should the Marketplace **immediately allow** the inclusion and searching of non-cleaning service type contractors (e.g., maintenance, electrical, paint) to secure adoption from large accounts?
* If non-cleaning services are included, what are the **top five non-cleaning service types** that should be prioritized for data field creation?
* What is the **MVP feature** that will demonstrate superiority over a basic **Excel tracker** for managing existing subcontractor relationships?
* What is the plan to transition existing **Excel/Google Maps data** into the Route platform for companies like New Image?

While they raised some concerns about our ability to deliver a product (which we addressed), they’re open to working with us once we go live. Currently, they manage 15–20 cleaning and 40+ maintenance subcontractors using Excel and Google Maps, handling 1–2 subcontracts monthly across 20 states.All that said, here are some takeaways we need to think through how we take companies like this with their own network of subcontractors, process to manage to these subcontractors and show them our platform is a better tool to BOTH MANAGE and EXPAND their subcontractor network. NOTE: This will open the door for contractors wanting us to add other non-cleaning service type contractors to the platform, e.g. paint, construction, electrical, etc. If we say YES to these additions, we will like get companies to agree to move over, although if we say cleaning only companies in our platform, we will likely get push back as they will not want to manage contractors from two systems.REPLAY LINK BELOW [https://fathom.video/share/oCHf97KySL-NnxqGfWYh98WgjNmtq-qT](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://fathom.video/share/oCHf97KySL-NnxqGfWYh98WgjNmtq-qT)""","Backlog",,"No priority","f0b082b4-3d52-41c6-875b-6cbe00f6f1c7","Feedback & Feature Requests Submissions","ernesto@getroute.com",,"Private Data",,,,,"2025-11-29T18:00:13.248Z","2025-12-09T20:34:38.766Z",,,,,,,,"",,,,"722afacf-ffd9-4024-bc30-72a4433f1039"
"ROUTE-602","Get Route","Data Sync, Search Feedback, and Geocoding Logic","## 2\. Feature Request Idea Summary

* **Feature:** Implement a user feedback mechanism for poor search results, update the geocoding logic for missing addresses, and ensure data sync consistency between HubSpot and Marketplace.
* **Goal:** Improve the accuracy of the Marketplace data, ensure proper account filtering, and gain user-driven insight into areas requiring more contractor coverage.
* **Problem Solved:** Prevents incorrect accounts from showing on the map, provides a fallback for geocoding, and ensures all services are captured in HubSpot for accurate filtering.

---

## 3\. User Story

1. **User Story: Search Feedback**

* As a **Marketplace User**,
* I want to **click a button to alert the team when my search results are poor**,
* so that **the team can focus on adding relevant contractors to that area and improve the search quality over time.**

2. **User Story: Account Sync/Filtering**

* As a **HubSpot Admin**,
* I want to **ensure that if I change a company's ""Account Type"" in HubSpot, they are instantly removed from the Marketplace map if they no longer qualify**,
* so that **only eligible contractors are visible to Primes.**

---

## 4\. Acceptance Criteria (AC)

### Data Sync and Filtering Logic

* **HubSpot Services Sync:** All service options currently available in the Marketplace filter tool must be added to the appropriate **HubSpot fields** to ensure accurate data capture.
* **Account Type Update:** A change to the **COMPANY ACCOUNT TYPE** in HubSpot (e.g., removal of ""E-CC"") must immediately trigger the removal of that company from the Marketplace map/search.

### Geocoding Fallback

* **Geocoding Priority:** If an E-CC account is missing the primary **Address 1** field (due to P.O. boxes or privacy concerns), the system must use the **City, State, Zip/Postal Code, and Country** as a **fallback** to place a PIN on the map.

### International and Location Handling

* The system must investigate the odd results when attempting to look up non-U.S. locations (e.g., Mexico ZIP codes) to ensure the ZIP and Country fields are correctly processed when international functionality is activated.

### Poor Search Results Feedback Mechanism

* A clickable **button/link** must be added to the search results page (or search interface).
* Clicking the button must trigger an **alert email** to the internal team (e.g., Product/Sales).
* The alert must capture the **user's email address** (for reply), the **search parameters** used, and the **geographic area/needs** that yielded poor results.

---

## 5\. Open Questions for the Product Team

* Which **specific team email address** should receive the ""poor search results"" alert?
* What is the **exact HubSpot field name** for ""COMPANY ACCOUNT TYPE"" that is used to determine map visibility, and what is the required **sync cadence** to ensure immediate removal?
* Does the fallback geocoding logic (City/State/Zip) provide an **acceptable level of accuracy** for the MVP, or should we flag these pins as having a lower confidence score?
* For the **Mexico locations**, what is the expected output/behavior when using the Marketplace ZIP lookup tool (i.e., should it simply show no results, or is the current output showing incorrect U.S. results)?

* **Feature:** Add a data field or section to contractor profiles to track approval status with ISN (ISNetworld).
* **Goal:** Allow Prime contractors (like KleenMark) who service clients (like CBRE) to quickly verify if potential subs meet a specific third-party compliance requirement.
* **Problem Solved:** Ensures necessary vendor risk and compliance data is captured and visible for major real estate clients who require ISN approval.

---

## 4\. Acceptance Criteria (AC)

* A new data field must be added to the Contractor profile to capture **ISN (ISNetworld) Compliance Status**.
* The status field should include options to indicate the contractor's current status (e.g., **Approved/Verified**, **Pending**, **Not Applicable**, **Not Approved**).
* The system must allow a Contractor to input their **ISN ID** (or similar identifier) for verification (if verification is implemented later).
* The ISN Compliance Status field must be clearly visible on the contractor's profile when being viewed by a Prime contractor.

## 5\. Open Questions for the Product Team

* Is the current requirement simply to **capture the status** as stated by the contractor, or do we need to build an integration to **verify the status** directly with ISN?
* Where exactly should this field be placed within the contractor's profile (e.g., in the existing **Credentials** section or a new **Compliance** section)?
* What is the **timeline** for making a decision on the **ISN requirement** before we commit to implementation?

---

## 3\. User Story

1. **User Story: Opportunity Data Capture**

* As an **Admin/Prime Contractor**,
* I want to **input all key project details (cleanable area, service frequency, scope attachments) when listing an opportunity**,
* so that **subcontractors have complete information immediately, reducing back-and-forth and speeding up the bidding process.**

2. **User Story: UI Consistency**

* As an **Admin/Prime Contractor**,
* I want the **required fields and data capture process to be identical across Manual Add, Batch ZIP, and CSV Import methods**,
* so that **I don't waste time on duplicate or inconsistent data entry and can use the tool efficiently.**

---

I am assuming these contacts within HubSpot will eventually make it over to Route Marketplace or vice versa. To that end, each of these contacts will have 1) unique profiles on if/when/where their contact info is shared within Route Marketplace and 2) the email notices they should/need to receive.For example, a primary sale contact for a company needs to have their information shared in the company profile although there are 2 other sales contacts within the company. that may or may not need to be listed On the reverse side each of these three sales contacts want to be alerted to sales opportunity, although the president, director of marketing, accounts payables lead will not need to get these notices although they would like to be made aware of live events we are hosting, platform updates, etc. In short lots of communications variables.

"ROUTE-592","Get Route","Show Registration and Profile Progress","# 2\. Feature Request Idea Summary

* Add a visual status to easily filter and see if E-CC accounts are **registered** or **unregistered**.
* Display the **percentage of profile completion** on public account cards to encourage finishing profiles.
* Use both statuses in Marketplace and HubSpot to target users with correct messaging and opportunities.

# 3\. User Story

There are two distinct user stories:

1. Story Title: Track Account Registration Status
   * As a marketing or sales user,
   * I want to easily see and filter if an E-CC account is registered or unregistered in Marketplace and HubSpot,
   * so that I can send the right marketing messages to encourage conversion and target registered users with opportunities.
2. Story Title: Encourage Profile Completion
   * As a contractor account owner,
   * I want the Marketplace to show my profile completion status to others,
   * so that I feel indirect pressure to finish my profile and receive stronger, more accurate job recommendations.

# 4\. Acceptance Criteria (AC)

### **A. Registered vs. Unregistered Status**

* All E-CC accounts in Marketplace must display a clear **visual indicator** (e.g., color or icon) showing if the account is **Registered** or **Unregistered**.
* The **Registered Status** must be a filterable field in the Marketplace search results.
* The **Registered Status** must be a filterable field within HubSpot for segmentation.

### **B. Profile Completion Status**

* Each account's profile card in the Marketplace must publicly display a **Profile Completion Percentage**.
* The visual display for completion should use a **circular progress ring** (e.g., Apple Watch style).
* The progress ring must reflect the percentage accurately: 25% filled for a quarter-complete profile, 100% filled for a fully complete profile.
* The completion percentage is key to generating **stronger, dialed-in recommendations** for Prime contractors.

---

# 5\. Open Questions for the Product Team

* What are the specific fields that define **100% profile completion** (e.g., required registration fields plus supplementary data)?
* What is the threshold or logic for making contract/opportunity details ""more available"" to accounts with higher completion percentages?
* What exact color shading or icon will be used to distinguish between Registered and Unregistered accounts?

> 1. Registered vs. Unregistered Accounts Add a visual indicator (e.g., color shading or icon) to easily distinguish between registered and unregistered E‑CC accounts in Marketplace. Make this status a filterable field in both Marketplace and HubSpot to support segmentation and marketing outreach. This will help us push opportunities to registered users and better target unregistered accounts for follow-up and conversion campaigns.
> 2. Profile Completion Status Display the percentage of profile completion on each account’s profile card (e.g., “Profile 62% Complete”). This metric should be publicly visible to apply indirect social pressure on account owners to finish completing their profile. For a more engaging visual element, consider using a circular progress ring similar to the Apple Watch activity tracker:25% complete = quarter ring filled 50% complete = half ring filled 75% complete = three-quarter ring filled 100% = full ring Objective Encourage full registration and profile completion by making both status and progress visible and filterable. Prioritize sharing opportunities with registered accounts while nudging unregistered users to take action.

>
> Any request I submit are for logging and initial prioritizing. We can assign and where applicable discuss priority level once we start to see the requests in a centralized location.  It should be noted, the heavy lift we will soon be facing is getting contractors to 1) create an account and 2) complete their profile so that we are dialing in strong recommendations quickly.  Currently we can find the contractors in an area quickly although are not sure they are a good match as we are lacking their profile data.  Lastly, this filtering in Marketplace and HubSpot will make it easier to market to those that have and have not registered for an account (two different messages).  Thanks

> Ernesto   Aug 4th at 5:06 PM Can you clarify what you mean by ""dialing in strong recommendations""?
>
> Jack Ellison   Aug 4th at 5:14 PM Sure a contractor comes to us and advises they need a contractor in zip code 06103 which is meets the following search filter A, B, C, D, E.  The more we push for 100% profile completion which includes profile data we ask for during the registration as well as the supplemental profile data, e.g. expanded Industries, Account Types, Ratings, Associations, Certifications, etc. we will begin to collect, the quicker we get to providing stronger first time recommendations and opportunities for those contractors completing their profiles.  KEEP IN MIND: On the reverse side, we will also be able to advise contractors why they are potentially missing opportunities (not being found in a search/filter) due to an incomplete profile or not having a particular qualifying filter search a customer is searching for, e.g. not ISSA member, not able to provide solar panel cleaning, does not provide medical cleaning services.
>
> Jack Ellison   Aug 4th at 5:27 PM as you take all this in, I feel think our average subcontract search (filter) for the next six months will be between 12-25 locations per project, which means we are being asked to deliver to a Prime (depending on the density of the market) around 3-5 subcontractor options per location (zip code) - so the ability for us to help ""dial in"" strong initial suggestions based on ""fuller"" profile data is key to keeping the total number of companies they have to vet, answer FAQ, negotiate with, etc. will be key to driving our value and price point.  Right now we are having to recommending 5-8 potential contractors as we have no profile data other than zip, thus they need to vet (in the case of 12-25 locations per project estimate above) anywhere between 60-200 companies.   Let me know if this does not make sense.

* This addresses a priority request to improve critical communication channels for clients and partners.

## User Story

* As a **Contractor User**,
* I want to have **separate, designated fields for Phone, Cell, and a mandatory After Hours/Emergency number** on my profile,
* so that all necessary parties can **contact me efficiently based on urgency and time of day**, improving communication and response times for critical events.

"ROUTE-579","Get Route","Ratings and Reviews","# 💡 Feature Request Idea Summary

* Allow **internal users** (PRIME/SUBCONTRACTOR) to request and submit structured feedback/ratings on their collaborative work, possibly tied to a Quarterly Business Review (QBR) cycle.
* The feedback mechanism must use a **1-5 star rating** system with half-star increments and include a mandatory text **feedback field** for each question.
* All ratings and reviews must be viewable in a **detailed summary** that includes aggregation, filtering (e.g., date range, score), and **transparent counter-responses** while keeping the identities of the PRIME/SUBCONTRACTOR who rated them visible *only* to each other.

---

## User Story

* As a **PRIME or SUBCONTRACTOR user**,
* I want to **initiate, submit, and view structured, aggregated, and filterable ratings and reviews** for partnership opportunities with appropriate transparency and access controls,
* so that **performance is officially tracked, analyzed over time, and openly discussed** between the involved parties without public exposure of the partnership details.

## **Acceptance Criteria (AC)**

* The system must allow a user to initiate a rating/review for an active opportunity after a defined period (e.g., related to a QBR cycle).
* The rating form must require a **1-5 star rating** with **half-star increments** (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, etc.) and a **mandatory feedback field** for each question.
* The system must automatically calculate and display an **overall star rating** upon completion of the review.
* A dedicated dashboard must display submitted ratings and reviews individually and as an **aggregated summary**.
* The summary must include filtering options by **date range** (e.g., Past 6 Months, Past Year), **score** (e.g., highest to lowest), and **chronology** (e.g., newest to oldest).
* Users must be able to **submit a counter-response** to any submitted review.
* All submitted feedback and counter-responses must be visible and transparent to platform users.
* **Access Control:** The identity of the **PRIME and SUBCONTRACTOR** involved in a specific review must **only be visible to those two involved parties**; all other users must see an anonymized view.

> As far as timing of the ratings/reviews, we need 1) to allow some time to pass and engagement/work to occur before actively requesting feedback (I am thinking we use QBR - Quarterly Business Reviews Reminder to spur this feedback by active opportunity), 2) for each question we need a 1-5 star rating with 1/2 star integrals with feedback fields for each question - at the end of each rating review the data enter will produce an overall start rating.  The ratings/reviews will be viewable individually but also aggregated to provide a summary with filters, e.g. newest to oldest, highest to lowest, Past 6 Month, Past Year, Past 3 years, etc  and 3) we have to be transparent with the feedback and any counter responses although we do not want to share publicly the PRIMES and the SUBCONTRACTORS working together - this was a clear takeaway from ISSA (behind the scenes the PRIME and SUBCONTRACTOR will see who is rating and reviewing them).

* The existing **""W-2 vs 1099 Data Capture/Calculation""** needs to be updated to capture a more accurate and flexible view of a company's subcontracting utilization.
* The current **""Company Size (W-2 Employees)""** field should be made clearer by updating its header.
* The vague **""1099 Subcontracted %""** field should be replaced with **two specific, quantitative metrics** that allow Prime Contractors to better filter, assess, and engage with potential subcontractors.

## User Story

As a **Subcontractor**, 

I want to **input specific, standardized metrics** regarding my company's **W-2 employee size and 1099 subcontracting utilization**, 

so that **Prime Contractors can accurately filter and assess my company's capabilities** based on their self-performing vs. subcontracting requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

* The header/label for the existing field tracking W-2 employee count is updated to **""Company Size (W-2 Employees)""**.
* The following new data fields are added to the company profile data capture section (replacing the current ""1099 Subcontracted %"" field):
  * **Number of Subcontractor (1099) Companies** (Input field for an integer/whole number).
  * **Percentage Of Work Subcontracted** (Input field for a percentage, allowing one decimal place, e.g., XX.X).
* Both new fields are **mandatory** to ensure Prime Contractors have the baseline information required for filtering.
* The system must store the data for the new fields and display them on the contractor's profile viewable by Prime Contractors.

> Based on feedback from Frank W. at The Facilities Group (they work with over 3,000 ISP - Independent Service Providers) as it pertains to the W-2 vs 1099 Data Capture/Calculation Discussion, they calculate from two angles - Revenue % and % Of Contract.  Revenue % is an easy to understand calculation, although while % Of Contract is easy to calculate at the Opportunity Level (can go % labor hours, % revenue, % people), when you start to roll all Opportunities and Contracts into a Company Level snapshot, the number becomes a little more gray and ""what it you want it to be for the client calculation"".
> Based on this feedback and other feedback collected, proposing we update the W-2 vs 1099 Data Capture/Calculation as follows:
>
> * a) For the **Company Size (W-2 Employees)** data point < suggest we update header as shown to left so clear and we still utilize and capture the current drop down range

"ROUTE-550","Get Route","Add a ICON/Tool that allows for quick OPEN 24 Hours Day","## 💡 Feature Request Idea Summary

* The user needs a dedicated **tool or icon** to facilitate the creation of an opportunity that is **open for bidding for 24 hours**.
* This tool should be easily accessible, suggesting a **quick-action button** or similar UI element.
* The goal is to streamline the process for rapidly soliciting bids for time-sensitive needs.

## User Story

As an **Opportunity Creator (Prime Contractor)**, I want a **dedicated ""Quick 24-Hour"" button** on the opportunity creation screen, so that I can **instantly set the bidding window to close after exactly 24 hours** without manually adjusting the time/date.

## Acceptance Criteria

* A new, clearly labeled **ICON/Tool/Button** (e.g., ""24-Hour Quick Bid"" or clock icon) is added to the Opportunity Creation flow.
* When the user clicks this button, the system **automatically populates the bidding end date/time** to be exactly **24 hours from the current time** (or the time the opportunity is published/made live).
* Clicking the quick-action button must **overwrite any manually entered closing date/time**.
* The user must still have the **ability to manually adjust** the closing date/time after clicking the 24-hour button.
