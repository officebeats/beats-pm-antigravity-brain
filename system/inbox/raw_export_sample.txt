Row 3: [ROUTE-621] [Jacks Big Beautiful Feedback] [### Platform Polishing, Data Logic Updates, and Credential Management
 
 ***Problem Statement** Users currently experience friction when entering and interpreting financial data due to a lack of standard number formatting (commas), leading to potential errors in revenue reporting. Furthermore, Prime contractors and Facility Managers lack sufficient granularity regarding a Service Provider's union status and subcontracting habits, making it difficult to assess fit for specific contracts. Finally, the Opportunity creation process omits key data points required for automation and proper matching, while the Credentials area exposes the platform to liability through vague verification terminology and lacks necessary sharing tools for business owners.*
 
 **Product Scope**
 
 **1. General UI & Formatting**
 
 * **Currency Formatting:** Implement automatic comma insertion for all revenue/currency input fields across registration and profiles (e.g., display 1,000,000 instead of 1000000).
 * **Profile Card Indicators:** Differentiate the UI visual (color-coding) for "Claimed" versus "Unclaimed" profiles in the contractor list.
 * **Reporting:** Add "Claimed/Unclaimed" status column to the Zip Code Export Report.
 
 **2. Company Profile & Data Logic**
 
 * **Union Field Update:** Change the "Union Labor Utilized" dropdown to support three options: Union, Non-Union, and Dual (Union & Non-Union).
 * **Emergency Contact:** Add a "Company Emergency Number" field (Internal use only/Not public).
 * **Service Hours:** Add a "24 Hours" checkbox/icon to the service schedule interface to eliminate ambiguity regarding start/end times.
 * **Subcontracting Logic (W-2 vs 1099):**
  * Update W-2 header to "Company Size (W-2 Employees)".
  * Replace the single "1099 %" field with two distinct fields:
  1. **Number of Subcontractor (1099) Companies** (Integer).
  2. **Percentage of Work Subcontracted** (Percentage to 1 decimal place).
 
 **3. Opportunity Creation Enhancements**
 
 * **Privacy Indicators:** Add visual labels to the creation form clearly distinguishing which fields are Public vs. Private to protect client identity.
 * **New Required Fields:**
  * Exchange Opportunity # (System-generated Unique ID).
  * Opportunity Type (Recurring or One-Time).
  * Service Frequency.
  * Total Cleanable Area (sq ft) - *Replaces generic Sq Footage*.
  * Union Labor Required (Yes/No toggle, default to No).
  * Contract Term (Months).
  * Target Start Date.
  * Tag Work Opportunities (Yes/No).
 * **Resources:** Add a download link for the "New Opportunity Intake Template" on the creation page.
 
 **4. Credentials & Partnerships**
 
 * **Owner Actions:** Enable "View," "Share" (via email link), and "Download" functionality for uploaded documents for users with Company Owner permissions.
 * **Terminology & Copy Updates:**
  * Change "Verified" header to "Credentials."
  * Update "Upload for verification" prompts to "Upload your current \[Document Name\]" to reduce platform liability regarding validity confirmation.
  * Update progress summary from "Validated" to "Exchange Received" or "Uploaded."
  * Add specific instructions for multi-state business licenses (upload corporate office registration).
 * **Partnership Integration:** Insert a call-to-action block for **Limn Insurance** ("Request Your Complimentary Insurance Review") with the associated external link.
 
 **5. Services Taxonomy**
 
 * Execute the registration and profile service clean-up per the provided Google Doc specifications.

 **User Experience (UX) Flow**
 
 **Profile Management**
 
 1. User enters revenue figures; system auto-formats with commas instantly.
 2. User selects "Dual" under Union status if they utilize both labor types.
 3. User enters subcontractor count and percentage of work outsourced to provide a transparent operational snapshot.
 4. User toggles "24 Hours" for specific service days instead of manually selecting 12:00 AM - 11:59 PM.
 
 **Opportunity Creation**
 
 1. User starts a new opportunity and sees clear labels on which fields will be visible to the public network.
 2. User downloads the "Intake Template" if they need guidance on data collection.
 3. User inputs specific contract details (Cleanable area, Union requirements, Term length) which drives matching logic.
 4. System assigns a unique "Exchange Opportunity #" upon save.
 
 **Credential Management**
 
 1. User (Owner) uploads a document; text prompts ask for "Current" versions rather than implying platform verification.
 2. User sees a "Request Insurance Review" banner; clicking opens the Limn Insurance form in a new tab.
 3. User selects a specific uploaded credential and clicks "Share" to generate a link for external stakeholders.

 # **Raw Context**
 
 POLISHING: I have reviewed my Slack feedback and ask you please confirm the following POLISHING items are on the TO DO LIST for review/discussion next week.
 
 * **Exchange Revenue Numbers:** Any place in the registration or profile where $ numbers are being captured, requesting we update the data field so that commas are shown once numbers are entered. In short, it is not easy to enter number as the lack of commas makes you have to stop and count zeros, e.g 100000, 1000000 is harder to read/confirm than $100,000 or 1,000,000
 * **Company Profile Union Data Field**. Update as follows:
 * Union Labor Utilized (Header updated)
 * Union
 * Non-Union
 * Dual (Union & Non-Union). - I confirmed with Marc B and another company called Joys Cleaning Services a company can be both
 * **Contractor Pin Colors / Profile Card** (right column): Have different colors for Claimed Profile vs Non-Claimed
 * **Zip Code Export Report:** Add a column after Project Zip Code and clarify if company is **CLAIMED** or **Unclaimed**
 * Finalize what we are going to do on this topicl
 * [@Domenico Amoroso](https://routeplatform.slack.com/team/U02BNFH1PEH) [@The Ricardo Regalado](https://routeplatform.slack.com/team/UJ4V2FR52) Based on feedback from Frank W. at The Facilities Group (they work with over 3,000 ISP - Independent Service Providers) and SEJ Services as it pertains to the W-2 vs 1099 Data Capture/Calculation Discussion, they calculate from two angles - Revenue % and % Of Contract. Revenue % is an easy to understand calculation, although while % Of Contract is easy to calculate at the Opportunity Level (can go % labor hours, % revenue, % people), when you start to roll all Opportunities and Contracts into a Company Level snapshot, the number becomes a little more gray and "what it you want it to be for the client calculation".Based on this feedback and other feedback collected, proposing we update the W-2 vs 1099 Data Capture/Calculation as follows:
 * a) For the **Company Size (W-2 Employees)** data point < suggest we update header as shown to left so clear and we still utilize and capture the current drop down range
 * b) For the **1099 Subcontracted %** < Since the feedback we are receiving is every company calculates this percentage differently, e.g. employee (individual) vs subcontractor (individual), revenue W-2 vs 1099, account count W-2 vs 1099, I suggest we capture this data with two data fields/numbers that will give the Prime's enough baseline info and insights to understand the level of subcontracting occurring with a given contractor. Based on these two fields/numbers, the PRIME will be able to 1) filter in/out what they are looking for and 2) when a match is made determine if additional conversation is needed around a given opportunity, e.g. we want you to self performing this opportunity at minimum this percentage. The two data fields/numbers are:

 * **Number of Subcontractor (1099) CompaniesÂ Â Â Â xx**
 * **Percentage Of Work SubcontractedÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â xx.xÂ Â Â Â (carry out an extra decimal)**
 
 
 
 * **Service Hours**: Create a 24 Hours Icon/check box so that quick/easy to set and we are consistent with how we communicate those companies which provides service 24 HOURS for a given DAY, e.g. 6:00 AM to 6:00 AM is that viewed as 24 hours or is 12:00 AM to 12:00 PM, or 4:00 AM to 4:00 AM or 12:00 AM to ] [Credentialing, Data Field] [] 
Row 4: [ROUTE-619] [Loops Invitation Email Template Updates] [**Problem Statement** The current user invitation email lacks polish and clarity, leading to potential confusion for recipients. Spacing errors in dynamic name fields make the email look automated and low-quality. Furthermore, the absence of the "Inviter's" identity reduces trust (users don't know who is asking them to join), and inconsistent branding ("Route" vs. "Exchange") dilutes the product identity. Finally, there is no clear support path for users who encounter issues during the signup process.
 
 **Product Scope**
 
 * **Subject Line Optimization:** Update the subject line to be concise and brand-aligned: "You've been invited to join \[Company Name\] on Exchange."
 * **Variable Formatting:** Fix the HTML/CSS spacing logic for `{First Name}` and `{Last Name}` variables to remove awkward gaps in the greeting.
 * **Inviter Context:** Inject a dynamic variable to display the Name or Email of the Admin who triggered the invite (e.g., "invited by \[Admin Name\]").
 * **Branding Consistency:** Standardize text references within the body copy to "Exchange" (removing "Route" where redundant).
 * **Signature Formatting:**
  * Insert a line break before the sign-off for better readability.
  * Standardize sign-off name to: "Route Exchange Team".
 * **Support Footer:** Add a static footer or post-script directing users to help: "Have questions? Email us at support@getroute.com".
 
 **User Experience (UX) Flow**
 
 1. **Receipt:** User receives an email with the subject "You've been invited to join \[Company Name\] on Exchange."
 2. **Context:** User reads a clean greeting (no spacing errors) and immediately identifies *who* invited them (e.g., "John Doe has invited you...").
 3. **Action:** User clicks the primary call-to-action to join.
 4. **Fallback:** If the user is confused, they scroll to the bottom and see the `support@getroute.com` contact info.

Row 5: [ROUTE-618] [AI Call Bots - autogenz.ai] [AI Voice Assistant & Automated Scheduling
 
 **Problem Statement** Service providers currently face missed revenue opportunities due to their inability to answer every phone call, particularly after hours or during peak service times. Furthermore, manual data entry for caller intake is inefficient and prone to error. Users need an automated, "always-on" solution to capture leads, schedule appointments, and log prospect data without requiring a dedicated human receptionist.
 
 **Product Scope**
 
 * **Intelligent AI Call Bot:** Implement an AI-driven voice agent capable of answering inbound calls 24/7.
 * **Automated Appointment Scheduling:** Enable the bot to access the user's calendar availability and book appointments directly during the call.
 * **Caller Data Logging:** Automatically capture, transcribe, and log key caller information (Name, Intent, Contact Info) into the platform's CRM or Opportunity tracker.
 * **Integration/Vendor Assessment:** Evaluate "AutoGenz.ai" or similar vendors for potential API integration to power this feature.
 
 **User Experience (UX) Flow**
 
 1. **Configuration:** User enables "AI Assistant" in their settings and defines business hours and calendar availability.
 2. **Call Handling:** When a customer calls outside of hours (or if the line is busy), the AI agent answers immediately.
 3. **Booking:** The AI qualifies the lead and successfully schedules an appointment slot based on real-time availability.
 4. **Review:** User receives a notification and views the call summary and new appointment details populated in their dashboard.

Row 6: [ROUTE-617] [Profile Bluebook Comparisson] [ProView Digital Qualification Profile
 
 **Problem Statement** Subcontractors and suppliers struggle to efficiently demonstrate their capabilities and compliance status to General Contractors (GCs) during the preconstruction phase. They currently rely on disjointed manual methods (emails, PDF attachments) to share critical business data. GCs lack a centralized, standardized view to quickly assess a vendor's safety, financial stability, and project history, leading to slow vetting processes and missed bidding opportunities.
 
 **Product Scope**
 
 * **Public Profile Landing Page:** Create a branded, SEO-friendly digital storefront for the subcontractor that aggregates all key business data.
 * **Qualification Data Fields:**
  * **Safety & Compliance:** Dedicated section for EMR ratings, OSHA logs, and bonding capacity.
  * **Business Classifications:** Fields to display minority/business enterprise status (MBE/WBE), union status, and labor affiliations.
  * **Licensing & Insurance:** Structured display of license numbers, insurance limits, and expiration dates.
 * **Project Portfolio:** A gallery view allowing companies to upload images and descriptions of past projects, categorized by trade or sector.
 * **Service Area Mapping:** Visual or list-based display of the geographic regions and specific trades the company services.
 * **Secure Document Sharing:** A permission-based system allowing GCs to request access to sensitive financial or compliance documents directly through the profile.
 * **Trust Indicators:** "ProView" badging to visually indicate that the profile information has been verified or updated recently.
 
 **User Experience (UX) Flow**
 
 1. **Profile Configuration:** The subcontractor logs in and populates the "Qualifications" tab with EMR, bonding, and licensing data.
 2. **Portfolio Upload:** The user creates a new project entry, uploading high-res photos and tagging the specific trades performed (e.g., "Janitorial," "Facilities Maintenance").
 3. **Visitor View:** A General Contractor navigates to the profile and sees a summary dashboard ("At a Glance") showing years in business, primary contacts, and trade codes.
 4. **Inquiry Action:** The GC clicks a primary "Contact Us" or "Send Invitation" button to initiate a bid request directly from the profile header.

Row 7: [ROUTE-616] [Feedback from AZ Opportunity Posting] [### Opportunity Creation Safeguards & Profile UX Polish
 
 **Problem Statement** Users are encountering friction during critical workflows (Registration and Opportunity Creation) due to redundant data entry and a lack of safeguards against data loss. Specifically, users are losing progress when navigating away from the Opportunity form without saving. Furthermore, the UI lacks clarity regarding data visibility (Public vs. Private fields) and interaction affordances (expandable profile sections), leading to confusion and potential privacy leaks.
 
 **Product Scope**
 
 **1. Data Safety & Integrity (Opportunity Creation)**
 
 * **Unsaved Changes Warning:** Implement a modal trigger if a user attempts to navigate away from the "Create New Opportunity" page after entering data but before clicking "Create." Options: "Keep Editing" or "Discard Changes."
 * **Public vs. Private Labeling:** Add distinct visual badges or help text to the form fields to explicitly state which data is **Public** (visible to the network) and which is **Hidden** (internal use), specifically warning users not to put Client names in public fields.
 
 **2. Registration Flow Optimization**
 
 * **Address Auto-Fill:** Carry over the address entered in "Step 1: Claim Company" to pre-populate the address field in "Step 3" to eliminate redundant entry.
 * **HubSpot Sync:** If the company exists in the HubSpot database with a valid address, pre-populate this data into the Step 3 address block.
 
 **3. Profile UI & Data Fields**
 
 * **Expandable Affordance:** Add visible chevron icons (arrows) to the right side of the Company Profile section headers (Company Details, Address, Expertise) to clearly indicate these are expandable/collapsible menus.
 * **Website Formatting:** Add input logic or helper text to the Website URL field to handle/auto-correct entries with or without "www" or "https://".
 * **After Hours Number:** Add a "After Hours Phone" field to the Company Profile.
  * *Constraint:* Optional field.
  * *Visibility:* Initially visible only to "Exchange Team" role; reserved for future exposure to paying Primes.
 * **Mobile Number:** Add a "Mobile/Cell Phone" field to the individual **User Profile**.
 * **"Found Online" Clarification:** Add a tooltip or explanatory modal to the "Found Online" status badge in the Team Member list to explain what this status means (e.g., "Sourced via public data, not yet invited").
 
 **User Experience (UX) Flow**
 
 **Creating an Opportunity**
 
 1. User enters Opportunity details; distinct "Private" labels reassure them regarding client confidentiality.
 2. User clicks "Back" or a sidebar link by mistake.
 3. System halts navigation: "You have unsaved changes. Do you want to leave?"
 4. User selects "Keep Editing" and successfully saves the Opportunity.
 
 **Profile Interaction**
 
 1. User views Company Profile; Chevron icons clearly indicate which sections are closed.
 2. User expands "Service Availability" with a single click.
 3. User hovers over the "Found Online" status on a team member to read the definition.

 1. Registration: If the client is entering an address as part of STEP 1 of the Claim Your Company, why do they have to enter again as part of Step 3.Â Also, if we have the company in Hubspot with an address, can we pull this data to initially populate STEP 3 where address is requested.
 2. Create New Opportunity (REMINDER TO SAVE):Â Â Just performed a demo with a client posting the AZ Opportunity and after he added all the data, he did not click the CREATE OPPORTUNITY and ended up losing the data when he went to view the opportunity on the map.Â Â If data is entered in any of these fields and the user attempts to move to another screen, we need a REMINDER TO SAVE warning to pop-up asking to SAVE or not.
 
 Â Â 3\. Create New Opportunity:Need to clearly state which data fields are public and hidden with note not to include any client or prospect data in the public fields
 4.Â Company Profile: The sections that can be expanded it is easily clear these sections can be expanded.Â SEE PIC2
 5.Â Company Website entry, are they suppose to add www or not?
 6.Â We need AFTER HOURS number field added to profile.Â This number should be an optional field and initially only visible to EXCHANGE TEAM MEMBERS at this point.Â This number will be eventually be visible to paying PRIMES and serve as an additional touch point in emergency situations, e.g. after hours, holiday, weekends.

Row 8: [ROUTE-615] [Large-Scale Opportunity Posting & Management (CSV Data Points)] [**Problem Statement** The current Opportunity creation process is optimized for small-scale projects (1â€“5 locations) but becomes inefficient and unmanageable for large enterprise opportunities (25â€“250+ locations). Manually entering data for hundreds of sites is time-consuming, and the platform currently lacks the hierarchy to distinguish between "Global" requirements (applicable to all sites) and "Location-Specific" nuances (addendums). Furthermore, without a centralized Q&A or feedback mechanism, Primes are overwhelmed by repetitive inquiries and lack visibility into site conditions that they cannot physically visit.
 
 **Product Scope**
 
 **1. Bulk Data Ingestion**
 
 * **CSV Template Upload:** Enable Primes to upload a standardized CSV file to populate all key data points for multi-location projects instantly.
 * **Key Data Mapping:** Ensure the uploader supports and maps the following fields:
  * Opportunity Name / Project Nickname
  * Exchange Opportunity # (Unique ID for tracking/billing)
  * Location Name & Type
  * Opportunity Type (Recurring/One-Time)
  * Services Needed (Multi-select display without dropdown friction)
  * Service Frequency
  * Total Cleanable Area (sq ft)
  * Contract Duration (Months)
  * Union Labor Required (Default: NO)
  * Tag Work Opportunities (Y/N)
  * Target Start Date
 
 **2. Documentation Hierarchy (Global vs. Local)**
 
 * **Global Scope of Work (SOW):** A master section for documents/links that apply to *all* locations in the Opportunity.
 * **Location-Level Addendums:** A specific section to attach exceptions or additions for individual sites (e.g., "Add 2x/year Window Washing at Location A," "Remove Restroom Cleaning at Location B").
 * **Global Support Documents:** General file attachments (e.g., Insurance Requirements, Safety Manuals) applicable to the whole project.
 * **Versioning Control:** All document uploads must support version tracking (e.g., v1.0, v1.01) with "Last Updated" timestamps and user attribution to track revisions.
 
 **3. Location Intelligence & Feedback**
 
 * **Subcontractor Field Reporting:** Create a "Location Feedback" section where Subcontractors can upload site-specific validation documents (Walk-through notes, Photos, Client docs). This allows Primes to "see" the location through the Sub's eyes.
 
 **4. Opportunity Q&A (FAQ Module)**
 
 * **Public FAQ Board:** Implement a section where Subcontractors can ask questions and Primes can post public answers, reducing repetitive 1:1 emails.
 * **Pre-Set Templates:** Allow Primes to select from a bank of standard FAQs during setup (e.g., "Is this active or potential?", "Payment Terms?", "Who provides chemicals?", "Background check required?").
 
 **User Experience (UX) Flow**
 
 **Prime (Poster) Journey:**
 
 1. **Setup:** User selects "Bulk Upload" and submits a CSV containing 50 locations.
 2. **Global Definition:** User uploads the "Master MSA" and "Standard Cleaning SOW" to the Global Documents section.
 3. **Refinement:** User navigates to "Location 12" and adds an SOW Addendum: "Requires High Dusting."
 4. **FAQ Prep:** User selects 5 standard questions (Payment, Insurance, Start Date) and pre-fills answers to deflect common queries.
 
 **Subcontractor (Bidder) Journey:**
 
 1. **Review:** User views the Opportunity and downloads the Global SOW.
 2. **Clarification:** User checks the FAQ section; sees payment terms are Net 45.
 3. **Site Visit:** User physically visits a specific location.
 4. **Reporting:** User uploads photos of a damaged floor to the "Location Feedback" section so the Prime is aware of pre-existing conditions.

 In working through several small (1â€“5 location) and a few medium-sized (25â€“30 location) Opportunities within our White Glove projects, I completed a thought study to understand what a 25, 50, 100, 250+ location Opportunity would require. The goal was to evaluate the information needed to efficiently post these Opportunities and to automate the marketing and value positioning to other contractors, as well as the details commercial contract cleaners need to generate accurate proposals and pricing.

Row 9: [ROUTE-611] [EMR Data Capture and Future Safety Metrics] [## 2\. Feature Request Idea Summary
 
 * **Feature:** Implement data scanning/scraping capability for the **Experience Modification Rate (EMR)** from an uploaded insurance document.
 * **Goal:** Satisfy key vetting requirements from large target contractors (like UG2) by capturing a critical safety metric.
 * **Problem Solved:** Ensures the system collects and stores a verifiable safety indicator that will be required for qualification checks.
 
 ---
 
 ## 3\. User Story
 
 * As a **Vetting Client** (e.g., UG2),
 * I want to **view and filter subcontractors based on their Experience Modification Rate (EMR)**,
 * so that **I can quickly verify their safety record and compliance before engaging them for a contract.**
 
 ---
 
 ## 4\. Acceptance Criteria (AC)
 
 * The system must support the upload and storage of the contractor's **EMR document** (provided by their insurance carrier) within the **COI/Credentials** section.
 * The system must implement technology (e.g., OCR/AI text scan) capable of **scanning or scraping the numerical EMR value** from the uploaded document.
 * The extracted **EMR value** must be stored as a dedicated, searchable field in the contractor's profile.
 * The extracted EMR value must be available for use in **contractor search filters**.
 * **Future Scope:** TRIR (Total Recordable Incident Rate) and deeper **OSHA compliance** metrics are acknowledged as future scope and are added to the parking lot.
 
 ---
 
 ## 5\. Open Questions for the Product Team
 
 * Since the EMR document is separate from the COI, should the system implement a **separate upload field** specifically for the EMR document, or should it be grouped under the existing COI upload?
 * What is the **data type** required for the EMR score (e.g., decimal number, and how many places, like `0.85` or `1.15`)?
 * What is the defined **acceptance benchmark** for the EMR score (e.g., is a score below 1.0 desirable, as per previous feedback)?

Row 10: [ROUTE-610] [Contract Posting Options and Scope Detail] [## 2\. Feature Request Idea Summary
 
 * **Feature:** Implement contract visibility settings (Open vs. Closed), standardized timeframe options, logic to break down hourly rates from budget, and flexible Scope of Work (SOW) capture tools.
 * **Goal:** Provide Prime contractors with control over who views and applies for opportunities, clarify contract requirements upfront, and support contractors of all sizes in creating detailed SOWs.
 * **Problem Solved:** Ensures accurate financial and schedule expectations are set, and protects client anonymity until an award is made.

 ## 3\. User Story
 
 1. **User Story: Contract Visibility**
  * As a **Prime Contractor**,
  * I want to **select between an "Open" or "Closed (Invite Only)" visibility setting when posting a contract**,
  * so that **I can control which subcontractors are allowed to view and apply for the opportunity.**
 2. **User Story: Standardized Scope and Rate**
  * As a **Contractor**,
  * I want to **see clear contract timeframes (e.g., 5x week) and access a structured SOW template if the Prime doesn't provide one**,
  * so that **I can quickly and accurately estimate the required effort and budget.**

 ## 4\. Acceptance Criteria (AC)
 
 ### Contract Visibility and Client Data
 
 * **Visibility Selector:** A mandatory selection field must be included during contract posting setup:
  * **Closed (Invite Only):** Only specific invited subcontractors can view and apply.
  * **Open (Come one come all):** Any qualified subcontractor can view and apply.
 * **Client Anonymity:** The **customer name** must be captured but **not shared** with any Subcontractors until the contract is **formally awarded**.
 * **Client Location:** The **account location name** must be captured and displayed to Subcontractors *before* the award to clarify the project site.
 
 ### Timeframe and Budget
 
 * **Timeframe Clarity:** The system must offer clear, standardized options for service frequency/timeframe, including: **1 Time Project** and recurring services (e.g., **1x Week Service, 5x Week Service**, etc.).
 * **Rate Breakdown:** If the Prime enters a total **"Budget"** for a contract, the system must have logic to **break down this amount into an estimated hourly rate** based on the entered service timeframe, to aid the subcontractor's estimation.
 
 ### Scope of Work (SOW) Flexibility
 
 * **SOW Capture must support two paths:**
  1. **Contractor-Provided SOW:** The Prime can upload their own existing SOW document.
  * This must support a **global SOW** document for standard services.
  * This must support **site-specific work** (additions/exceptions outside the global SOW) via separate attachments or fields.
  2. **Template SOW (For Contractors without SOW):** The system must offer a pre-defined template for Primes to fill out or for Subs to reference, including the following columns:
  * **AREA** (e.g., Exterior: Entry/Exist, Interior: Restrooms, etc.)
  * **TASK**
  * **FREQUENCY**
  * **NOTES**

 ## 5\. Open Questions for the Product Team
 
 * For the **Rate Breakdown**, what is the **standard assumption for "total hours"** (or similar variable) that should be used to convert a total contract budget into an estimated hourly rate?
 * What is the **maximum file size and format** that will be accepted for SOW uploads (both global and site-specific)?
 * Should the **Template SOW** (option 2) be primarily a reference **downloadable document**, or should we build an **in-platform tool** for Primes to fill out?
 * Does the **Contract Location Name** need to be anonymized (e.g., "A Major Retail Store in Dallas, TX") or can it be the specific name of the facility location (e.g., "Dallas Store #123")?

 > "@Ernesto Let's have a discussion around the following: Closed (Invite Only) vs Open (Come one come all) Contracts - Selected by PRIME at time of contract posting set-up Clarifying timeframe, e.g. 1 time project, 1x week service, 5x week service, etc. and Breaking Down Hourly Rate if "Budget" is entered by Prime.
