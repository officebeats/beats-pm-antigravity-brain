# Daily Synthesizer Skill

Generate succinct, fluff-free, table-based briefings.

## Workflow

1.  **Snapshot**: Read `STATUS.md` and `TASK_MASTER.md`.
2.  **Adaptive Briefing**:
    - **Morning**: Focus on the day's goals and blockers.
    - **Evening**: Focus on wins and drafting the next day's plan.
3.  **Succinctness**: No prose unless explicitly asked. Tables only.
