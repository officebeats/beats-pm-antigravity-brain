## 💡 How This Works

This file is a **living dashboard** maintained by the AI agents. When you:

- Capture a `#boss`, `#bug`, `#task`, or `#feature` → It appears in **Recently Captured**
- Mark something as critical → It moves to **Critical / In-Flight**
- Run `#status` or `#day` → The AI refreshes this file with the latest state

You can also manually edit this file anytime.
